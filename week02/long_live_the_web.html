                In <em>Long Live the Web</em>, Tim Berners-Lee says the Web should stay open, universal, and free from control by companies or governments. He explains that when access is restricted, the basic values of the Web—equality, innovation, and freedom—are damaged. This point really spoke to me, because I’ve seen what happens when these values are ignored.

                One of his main warnings is about “walled gardens,” closed systems that limit user freedom. Apple is a good example. Their products are designed to work best only with other Apple devices. iTunes, for instance, locks your music and media inside their system. That means you can’t easily move your content to other devices. As a customer, you end up buying more Apple products just to keep using what you already own. While the system feels smooth and polished, it takes away choice and hurts the Web’s universality, which Berners-Lee believes is essential.

                I also connected his concerns about governments to my time living in China. As an international student there, I had to buy a VPN just to access Google, YouTube, or even school resources. The government’s censorship creates a divided version of the Web, where people are cut off from global information. Berners-Lee warns that this kind of control—whether from authoritarian or democratic governments—weakens the Web’s openness. Living under these limits showed me that free access matters not just for convenience, but also for learning, connecting with others, and even personal freedom.

                Reading this article made me see the Web as more than just a tool. It’s a shared resource that supports democracy and human rights. When companies like Apple or governments like China block access, they threaten the Web’s promise of being universal. As Berners-Lee says, the Web must be defended—and from my experiences, I understand why this fight is so important.
