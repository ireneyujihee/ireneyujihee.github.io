                Berners-Lee’s ideas also connect to Mozilla’s Pledge for a Healthy Internet. Principle 2 says the internet is a public resource that should stay open and accessible. But Apple’s closed system and China’s censorship both go against this. When companies or governments block parts of the Web, they take away equal access to information and services. Principle 4 says people’s security and privacy should never be optional. Yet in China, people’s online activity is always watched, and in Apple’s system, users give up control of their personal data for convenience. These examples show how quickly the Web’s original values can be weakened. They also show why openness, privacy, and access must be protected if the internet is going to serve everyone.
