            <p>I didn’t expect The Medium is the Message to resonate with me as much as it did — especially as someone studying Brain and Cognitive Science. Usually, theory-heavy readings feel abstract, but McLuhan made me feel his point. It wasn’t just about media or technology; it was about how the way we experience things — visually, aurally, socially — literally reshapes how we think. That’s what hooked me.</p>
            <p>What stood out most was McLuhan’s idea that the medium itself affects us more deeply than the content. As a cognitive science student, that instantly reminded me of how our brains adapt to sensory environments. Like, the way repeated exposure to screens might rewire attention networks or how fast media trains us to process information in fragments instead of narratives. It’s almost like neuroplasticity at the societal level — the medium changing not just communication, but cognition itself.</p>
            <p>I kept thinking about perception too. The human brain doesn’t just receive sensory input — it constructs experience out of it. McLuhan’s point felt similar: every medium filters and reorganizes reality in a new way. When we scroll through endless short videos, our brains aren’t just consuming; they’re learning a new rhythm of engagement, a new way of perceiving time and relevance.</p>
            <p>His “global village” idea also hit differently when I thought about it through a neuroscience lens. Instant communication has basically rewired how we form social identities and empathy. Our brains evolved for face-to-face interactions, yet now we’re emotionally reacting to pixels and avatars. It made me think about mirror neurons — how they might respond to digital expressions the same way they do in person — and what that means for emotional connection or even desensitization online.</p>
            <p>Overall, McLuhan’s message feels like a cognitive science case study waiting to happen. He wasn’t just talking about media; he was predicting how human consciousness itself would evolve alongside it. Reading this made me realize that studying the brain isn’t just about neurons and behavior — it’s also about understanding the mediums that shape our collective thought patterns.</p>
