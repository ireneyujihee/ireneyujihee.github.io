            <ul>
                <li style = "color: black; font-size:25 px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Written in 1945, the essay is fascinating as it offers a view on how people perceived the rapid growth of technilogy and their prediction of the future. In particular, the author observes the growth of scientific information which he deams overwhelming and expresses his concern on humanity. To resolve this issue, he proposes "Memex", a hypothetical device that could store vast amount of information and allow users to create association between ideas. It is truly amazing and shocking how he quite essentially predicted the foundations of present day's information society.</li>
                <li style = "color: black; font-size:25 px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What makes Bush's essay influential is not just the technology he imagined, but the change in perspective he proposed. He recognized and predicted that retrieval of information would eventually become networked rather than linear </li>
                <li style = "color: black; font-size:25 px; font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Reading this essay was almost uncanny to me because we are literally living in the world Bush imagined of. I am essentially working within Bush's framework when I open a browser and click through hyperlinks. </li>
