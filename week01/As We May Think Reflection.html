            <h1 style = "color:forestgreen; font-size:40 px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;text-align: center;">Reflection on <em>As We May Think</em> by Vannevar Bush</h1>
            <ul>
                <li style = "color: black; font-size:25 px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The first thought that came to my mind after finish reading the essay is that it is creepy yet fascinating how Bush could predict all these in 1945. It reveals how people who were living in the midst of the rapid growth of technology perceived the drastic change.</li>
                <li style = "color: black; font-size:25 px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Personally, I felt that our current generation is in a similar position with Bush’s generation: we are observing the daunting growth of technology and scientific information with AI. </li>
                <li style = "color: black; font-size:25 px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">It also got me to wonder, “Since Bush accurately predicted the present day use of technology and information, are these predictions of creation of AGI and extinction of humanity also going to happen? If so, when?”</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 style= "color:forestgreen; font-size:40 px; font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;text-align: center;">Take a break and enjoy a cup of matcha</h2>
